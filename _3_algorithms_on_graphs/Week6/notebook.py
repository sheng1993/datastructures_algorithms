"""Shortest Path
Input: A graph G with non-negative edge
weights, a source vertex s and a target vertex t.

Output: The shortest path between s an t in G
"""


"""Reversed Graph
Reversed graph Gr for a graph G is the graph
with the same set of vertices V and the set of
reversed edges Er, such that for any (u,v) in E
there is an edge (v,u) in Er and vice versa.
